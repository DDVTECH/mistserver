MistServer is dedicated to the public domain.
This means anyone can use MistServer for any purpose - including commercial purposes - without any restrictions.

To allow use in jurisdictions where public domain dedications are not recognized, you may instead opt to distribute MistServer under the Zero-Clause BSD license.

However, note that while __MistServer itself__ is public domain software, __some of its dependencies are not__:
- `mbedtls` is used for HTTPS/encryption support, and available under the Apache 2.0 license or the GPL 2.0 license.
- `libsrtp2` is used for WebRTC support, and available under a BSD-style license.
- `usrsctp` is used for WebRTC datachannel support and available under the BSD-3-Clause license.
- `libsrt` is used for SRT support, and available under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
- `librist` is used for RIST support, and available under the BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License.
- The optional (disabled by default) MistInAV links against `libav`, which is available under the LGPL or GPL licenses.

Note that __all of these dependencies can be disabled__ by toggling build flags - but doing so will of course limit the capabilities of the resulting software accordingly.

__The MistServer name and logo are not public domain either.__ You have permission to use the MistServer name and logo to refer to any version of MistServer published by DDVTech B.V., but __not to refer to versions that contain changes not published by DDVTech B.V.__.

We hope you find MistServer useful, and __encourage mentioning you use MistServer__ and/or based your products/services on MistServer wherever you consider it appropriate. This is not required, but appreciated.
